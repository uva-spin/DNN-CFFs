Please check the Checks_for_Issues folder to see which kinematic sets produce either very large cross-section values or negative cross-section values.
 Note: In the files starts with filename *ATTENTION*, we haven't set F (cross-section) values to zero as it was done in the original data file AllJlabData_from_Zulkaida_and_Liliet.csv.
In the 'Pseudo_data_with_sampling.csv' file, F values were set to zero if the correspondin ones were set to zero in the file AllJlabData_from_Zulkaida_and_Liliet.csv
