- Python version of the BKM10 Unpolarized DVCS Formulation: `BKM_DVCS_8Pars.py`. The pure DVCS dependence on all 8 CFFs is included.
- `compare_Fvalues.py` produces the `F_true_comparison_t2.csv` file that shows the xs values (F) using the BKM10 formulation with the KM15 CFFs model obtained with ROOT software (F_true) and python (F_true_py) which agree with each other.
